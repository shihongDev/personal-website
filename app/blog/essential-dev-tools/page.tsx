                Building Your Toolkit
              </h2>
              
              <p>
                The key to a productive development environment is finding tools that complement your workflow rather than disrupting it. Start with the basics and gradually add specialized tools as your needs evolve. Remember that the goal is to reduce friction in your development process, not to collect tools for their own sake.
              </p>

              <p>
                Consider factors like learning curve, integration capabilities, and long-term maintenance when evaluating new tools. The best tools are often those that solve real problems you're experiencing rather than those that seem impressive on paper.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most importantly, invest time in learning your chosen tools deeply. A few well-mastered tools are more valuable than many superficially understood ones.
