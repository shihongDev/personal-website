                1. Getting Started with Cursor IDE
              </h2>
              
              <p>
                To begin using Cursor, download the installer compatible with your operating system from the official website: <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" className="text-accent hover:underline">https://www.cursor.com/</a>. Follow the installation prompts to set up the IDE on your system.
              </p>

              <p>
                Upon launching Cursor, you'll notice the familiar VS Code interface with additional AI-powered features seamlessly integrated. The main difference lies in the enhanced capabilities that leverage AI to assist with coding tasks.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-subsection font-medium text-text-primary mt-12 mb-6">
                2. Core AI Features
              </h2>

              <h3 className="text-title font-medium text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
                Intelligent Code Completion
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                Cursor's AI-powered autocompletion goes beyond traditional syntax completion. It understands context, project structure, and coding patterns to suggest entire functions, classes, or code blocks. Simply start typing, and Cursor will provide intelligent suggestions that often anticipate your intent.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-title font-medium text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
                Chat with AI
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                One of Cursor's standout features is the integrated AI chat functionality. You can ask questions about your code, request explanations, or seek help with debugging. The AI understands your codebase context and provides relevant, actionable responses.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-title font-medium text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
                Code Generation
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                Describe what you want to build in natural language, and Cursor can generate the corresponding code. This feature is particularly useful for boilerplate code, implementing algorithms, or creating new functions based on specifications.
              </p>

                3. Essential Tips for Efficient Workflow
              </h2>

              <h3 className="text-title font-medium text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
                Leverage Context-Aware Suggestions
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                Cursor analyzes your entire codebase to provide context-aware suggestions. When working on a new feature, reference existing patterns in your code. The AI will learn from your project's conventions and suggest code that maintains consistency.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-title font-medium text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
                Use Natural Language Comments
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                Write comments describing what you want to implement, then let Cursor generate the code. For example, typing <code className="bg-border px-2 py-1 rounded text-small">// Function to validate email address</code> can prompt Cursor to suggest a complete email validation function.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-title font-medium text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
                Optimize the AI Chat
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                When using the chat feature, be specific about your requirements. Instead of asking "How do I sort an array?", try "How do I sort an array of objects by multiple properties in JavaScript?" The more context you provide, the better the AI response.
              </p>

              </h2>

              <h3 className="text-title font-medium text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
                Codebase Queries
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                Cursor can answer questions about your entire codebase. Ask questions like "Where is the user authentication logic?" or "Show me all API endpoints that handle user data." This feature is invaluable for understanding large or unfamiliar codebases.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-title font-medium text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
                Refactoring Assistance
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                Use Cursor's AI to help with code refactoring. Select a code block and ask the AI to optimize it, make it more readable, or convert it to a different programming paradigm. The AI can suggest improvements while maintaining functionality.
              </p>

                5. Best Practices and Limitations
              </h2>

              <h3 className="text-title font-medium text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
                Verify AI-Generated Code
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                While Cursor's AI is powerful, always review and test generated code. The AI might not always understand complex business logic or edge cases specific to your application. Use it as a starting point and refine as needed.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-title font-medium text-text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
                Maintain Code Quality Standards
              </h3>
              
              <p>
                Ensure that AI-generated code follows your project's coding standards. Configure Cursor with your preferred linting rules and code formatters to maintain consistency across your codebase.
              </p>
